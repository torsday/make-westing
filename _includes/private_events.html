        <p class="text-muted">Make Westing is available for a wide variety of private functions. We offer catering services (see below), and we do have a semi-private space that we can block off for smaller groups - best for sizes between 20 and 30 or as a base for larger groups - though we do not take table reservations. The rate for the semi-private space ranges from $100 an hour Sunday through Wednesday, $150 an hour on Thursdays and $200 on Saturdays (only until 10pm). We do not block the space off on Fridays. We section the space (towards the back of the bar) from the main bar with stanchions and the area includes three high-top tables as well as a banquette and the back bar. The only other area of Make Westing that we provide reservations for are the bocce courts. The courts are first come, first serve and are free. When there are others waiting, each group may play one game to seven and then give up the court to the next group in line. However, if you would like to rent the bocce courts, we do so at $50 per hour, per court, though we only rent one at a time so we can have the other open to the general public. Generally, for parties we charge $18 per person, per hour for an open bar and $11 per person, per hour for wine and beer only, though we can/do offer open tabs (at regular, non-happy-hour pricing) or drink ticket options - usually either $5 and $9 a ticket depending on what level of beer or liquor you're looking to provide. For all liquor and catering packages we add 18% gratuity.Finally, complete buyouts are available, but the costs vary dramtically based on time of day, day of week, time of year, length and complexity of the event, number of people, etc. Please contact us for more information.Throwing an event at Make Westing can be as simple or as complicated as a group wants as we will adjust/tailor events based on a particular groups needs/budget i.e. groups can pick and choose between drink packages, spacing options, etc. We have a 72 hour cancellation policy for the bocce courts and the back rental space. Once a catering order has been placed, we cannot cancel the order. Due to the nature of our liquor license, no one under 21 is allowed.
